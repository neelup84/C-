Project Three(The Zoo)
Description: As provided document and code, which includes all of the functional requirements necessary for Wildlife Zooâ€™s desired interface as well as where I should create the new code. This includes a description of the desired menu as well as the desired functionality of each menu option. The code must meet all of these functional requirements.

The project is created or implemented from TheZoo folder which is already provide by Southern New Universiyt final project . The main moto of the project is appear to be a C++ project with Java files.

There are two file given to review for this project:
 a.TheZoo.cpp: C++ code that links to the Java class using JNI
 b. ZooFileWriter.java: Java ZooFileWriter class which allows the user to write to a file
The following inter faces created which include:
 a.User Menu
 b.Generate a File (this code has been created for you; you will simply need to run this function)
 c.Loading Data
 d.Displaying Data
 e.Adding a Record
 f.Deleting a Record
 g.Saving Data
 
The code in C++ folder went particulary well. I tried three days to write the code in C++ code.
I optimized my code by using Appropriate Algorithm and operators
The piece of code was challengeing to connect C++ to Java, adding path in Library(java) and I think I need to work little bit more to make it correct.
This porject tought me how to write code for particular application, using appropirate alogritham, and secrue your code, improve efficency.These skills will be tranerable.
Writing comments to your code, code grouping, consistent Naming Schema are good practise to make your code readable and adpatable.


demonstrated industry standard best practices in all my code to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency which includes:
 a.Input validation and error handling to anticipate, detect, and respond to run-time and user errors
 b.Inserting in-line comments to denote your changes and briefly describe the functionality of the code
 c.Using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions throughout your code
 
The most exciting part I have ever learned is utilizing various programming languages to develop secure, efficient code in module six. In project three, the exciting part is writing a multiclass C++ interfacing prototype system for Wildlife Zoo that incorporates Java for specific functionalities and learned C++ code that links to the Java class using JNI. In project three, I have learned how to Utilize various programming languages to develop secure, efficient code. Used the C++ code to link to the Java class.
the assignment looks simple to connect C++ to Java, and I made mistakes adding paths in libraries.

Finally, It is wonderful expreice to create The Wild Life Zoo application.
